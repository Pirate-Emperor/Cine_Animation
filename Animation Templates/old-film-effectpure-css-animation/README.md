# Old Film Effect - Pure CSS Animation

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/yLjwOwQ](https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/yLjwOwQ).

The grain effect can be more visible in black or white, depending on the color of the background image, so I've added a button to invert the color of the grain effect. Also the sepia filter looks great on these vintage things, so I've added a button to turn it on or off... and it doesn't look too bad.
